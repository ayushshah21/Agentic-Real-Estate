## 1. Twilio & Ngrok Usage with VAPI

### Voice Calls

- VAPI's built-in telephony makes Twilio optional for handling calls
- VAPI can provision phone numbers or import Twilio numbers directly
- Twilio Media Streams/TwiML only needed if managing call audio manually
- VAPI integrates with Twilio under the hood for telephony

### SMS & Webhooks

- Twilio needed for SMS messaging and additional webhook handling
- VAPI focuses on voice AI, doesn't handle SMS natively
- Ngrok useful in development for exposing local server to Twilio webhooks
- In production, replace ngrok with deployed web service

### Call Forwarding

- VAPI supports call transfers via transferCall tool
- Simple forwarding possible without extra Twilio code
- Complex scenarios may require Twilio's conferencing capabilities

### Best Workflow

1. Use VAPI-provided number or import Twilio number into VAPI
2. Set up Twilio webhooks/VAPI Server URLs for event notifications
3. Use Twilio's voice APIs only for features VAPI doesn't cover

## 2. Best Knowledge Base Setup

### Initial Demo Knowledge Base

- Start small with targeted FAQ and key property information
- Upload documents (PDFs, text, Word) to create custom knowledge base
- Include sample property listings, real estate terms, and Q&A pairs
- Test assistant on specific questions to refine content

### Scaling to Real Agencies

- Integrate with MLS data feeds/APIs
- Use public real estate APIs (Zillow, Realtor.com)
- Access public records and property tax databases
- Consider neighborhood data APIs

### CRM and Internal Data

- Integrate agency CRM/database data
- Ingest past client inquiries and saved search criteria
- Maintain agency-specific knowledge bases
- Support multiple data sources including websites
